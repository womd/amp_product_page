AcceleratedMobilePage for Products:

the properties used in the product-viewmodel, should more or less be complete in any ecommerc-product-page...
it illustrates how a product-page could be built, that is indexed as such in webmastertools.

here some reminders:
- page needs to be in UTF-8
- styles need to be inline
- must contain schema.org structured data
- needs special tags for eg. images (amp-img), analyctics amp-analytics, scripts so they can be amp-cache

here some useful links:

happy AMP
